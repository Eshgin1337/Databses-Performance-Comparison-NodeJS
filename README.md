# Comparative Performance Evaluation of MongoDB and MySQL in a NodeJS Environment

Hello. This project is intended to evaluate the performances of two different databases in the NodeJS environment: in one's case the database is MongoDB, and in another's case it is MySQL. Both API routes written in NodeJS are used to create a "users" table and insert two parameters namely "email" and "password". In this process, I have used a popular tool named "Gatling" to evaluate the performances of both MongoDB and MySQL applications and make comparisons. The testing process has been carried out in a few scenarios; I have used the same number of insertations, but the number of requests per second varies for each case and double-testing has been conducted to ensure the results' preciseness. There are total 10000 total "email-password" pairs which were  extracted from the website: <a>"website_link"</a>. In this report, I will explain how you can install and set up the environment to perform the testing process on your own.
(If you want to familiarize yourself with the testing process of mine you can find the detailed explaination and comparison of results in <a>"mymediumlink"<a/>
